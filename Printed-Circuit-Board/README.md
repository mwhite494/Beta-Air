These are the board files for the attempt at a custom PCB shield designed in Eagle that would neatly package the pilot interface circuitry.
Unfortunately the board did not work consistently enough to use with the prototype but a future SEED team may wish to
look at these if they choose to make edits to the board for future iterations of the project.
This board uses some custom packages located in MTW.lbr.
